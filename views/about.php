                <b>Greetings!</b> My name is Pavle. I am a web developer (wannabe), student and a gamer. I am coding for 6 years now and that was
                my hobby for awhile so I decided to make some money out of it. I consider myself as a hard-working, detail-oriented person. My studies at the ICT
                college are helping me to improve my skills and develop the new ones.
                My focus on the studies and future career somehow managed to get me away from my favorite sport - tennis. I hope I will get back to it in the future.
